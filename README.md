This repository contains the code for a RESTful API that was built using the MEAN stack:


- MongoDB
- Express
- Angular
- NodeJS


# Prerequisites

- NodeJS: Download and Install [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank").

- MongoDB: Download and Install [MongoDB]("https://www.mongodb.org/downloads" target="_blank") - Make sure it's running on the default port (27017).</li>


# Additional Packages

- Express - web application framework for NodeJS.
- Mongoose - a NodeJS library that provides MongoDB object mapping.
- Body Parser - populates req.body with the value of the POST parameter.
- CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Enables requests of resources from a different domain.
- Angular 4 - a structural JavaScript framework for dynamic web apps.

# Quick Install
The quickest way to get started is to clone the project and utilize it like this:

1. Install dependencies from root folder using your command line:
`npm install`
*optionally you can install [nodemon]("https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon" target="_blank") which will monitor your source code and automatically restarts your server when detects any changes.
To install nodemon use:*
`npm install -g nodemon`

2. Add Your Auth0 Credentials
open the `environment.t`s and `environment.prod.ts` files located at `ng-src/src/environments/` folder, and add your Auth0 Client ID and Auth0 Domain name.

3. After installation is finished use:
`node server`
*or use this command if you've installed nodemon:*
`*nodemon server*`
